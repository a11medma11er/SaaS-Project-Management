## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: View not found
**Solution:** Clear view cache
```bash
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=RolesAndPermissionsSeeder
php assign_super_admin.php
```

### Issue: File upload fails
**Solution:** Check storage permissions
```bash
php artisan storage:link
chmod -R 775 storage
```
